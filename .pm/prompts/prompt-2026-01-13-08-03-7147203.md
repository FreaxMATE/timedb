# Actor
You are a senior software engineer.

# Context and goals
I want to deploy the database provided in the environment variable DATABASE_URL (without the metadata schema). I would also like to have a simple authentication in the FastAPI layer so that it requires users to provide an API key. The API key should be coupled with the tenant_id in the database, in other words it should be possible to create multiple users with the timedb CLI, give them API keys and then have them write to the same postgres database but isolated throught the tenant_id. 

# Tools, APIs, docs and keys
- This repo is using uv for package management and virtual environments [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). The virtual environment is named `.venv`.

# Constraints and guidelines
- The developed code should strive for high readability and maintainability.

# Success metrics
Make a test notebook (similar to the other notebooks) using the TEST_DATABASE_URL that shows how you can create useres through the timedb CLI and then using the generated API keys to push and load data from the database.
